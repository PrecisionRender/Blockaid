# Blockaid
A replay analysis, note-taker, and studying tool for block stacker games.

---

Unfortunately, Blockaid depends on [a feature](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/81621) not yet merged into Godot. 
If you want to contribute to Blockaid, you'll have to build [a custom fork of Godot](https://github.com/PrecisionRender/godot/tree/fix-popup-menu-accelerators) 
from source.
