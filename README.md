# Blockaid
A replay analysis, note-taker, and studying tool for block stacker games.

---

Unfortunately, this project depends on [a bugfix](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/81781) not yet merged in Godot. If you want to contribute to this project, you'll have to build [this custom fork of Godot](https://github.com/PrecisionRender/godot/tree/fix-windows-file-dialogue-file-seperators) from source.
